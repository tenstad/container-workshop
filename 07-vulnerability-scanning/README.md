# Vulnerability scanning

## Snyk

Docker Desktop includes vulnerability scanning by the third party provider
[Snyk](https://snyk.io/).

### Usage

See Docker's [Best practices for scanning images](https://docs.docker.com/develop/scan-images/).  
For the CLI, run `docker scan --help` to see usage instructions.

üìù Scan the `python` image and see what kind of critical vulnerabilities are found.

## Trivy

An alternative to `docker scan` and Snyk. To learn about trivy, go to the [Trivy
homepage](https://trivy.dev/) for feature highlights, or to the [Documentation
site](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.36/) for detailed information.

### Install

Refer to their
[Installation](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.36/getting-started/installation/)
documentation or simply download the latest release from the [GitHub trivy
release page](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/releases) if you do not care
about updates. If downloading from GitHub, select asset based on your operating
system. You probably want one of the following:

- [`trivy_0.36.0__Linux-64bit.tar.gz`](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/releases/download/v0.36.0/trivy_0.36.0_Linux-64bit.tar.gz)
- [`trivy_0.36.0__macOS-64bit.tar.gz`](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/releases/download/v0.36.0/trivy_0.36.0_macOS-64bit.tar.gz) (Intel chip)
- [`trivy_0.36.0__macOS-ARM64.tar.gz`](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/releases/download/v0.36.0/trivy_0.36.0_macOS-ARM64.tar.gz) (Apple chip)
- [`trivy_0.36.0__windows-64bit.zip`](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/releases/download/v0.36.0/trivy_0.36.0_windows-64bit.zip)

Using Linux og MacOS? Run this from your download folder after downloading:

```bash
sudo tar -xzf trivy_*.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/ trivy
```

Using Windows? Well good luck with that!  
(copy the extracted `trivy.exe` file to `C:/Windows` or any other folder in your
[`PATH`](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm#windows10))

### Usage

Trivy has a lot of functionality, more than just container image scanning!  
Run `trivy --help` for a complete list, or `trivy image --help` for the image
scanning section.

üìù Build the Dockerfile within this folder and scan the image with trivy.
