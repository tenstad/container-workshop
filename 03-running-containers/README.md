# Running Containers

The most basic command is `docker run <image>`, which instantiates a running
container from a given image. If the image is not already present on your
machine, it is automatically pulled first.

Try running the following:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

You should get an output starting with _Hello from Docker!_ indicating that
everything is setup correctly!
